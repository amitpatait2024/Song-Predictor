# Song-Predictor
Developed a machine learning model to predict a song’s popularity based on audio features such as danceability, energy, loudness, and tempo.

Objective: Developed a machine learning model to predict a song’s popularity based on audio features such as danceability, energy, loudness, and tempo.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Train-Test Split, Model Evaluation)

Key Contributions:

Collected and structured dataset containing key song attributes.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with correlation heatmaps and scatter plots to identify feature relationships. *Built and trained a Linear Regression model to predict popularity scores. *Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score. *Visualized actual vs predicted popularity for performance insights.
Outcome: Achieved a working predictive model capable of estimating song popularity from musical features, demonstrating strong understanding of regression analysis and model evaluation.
